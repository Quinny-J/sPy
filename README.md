## 📝 Todo (maybe)
- [x] Socket error handling
- [x] Make it a class 
- [x] Display multiple results on frontend 
- [x] Display closed and open ports in different tabs
- [] Make it faster somehow
- [x] Search for a single port
- [] Search for most popular ports (ex. 22,23,80,8080)
- [] Search for a range of ports (Function made but slow)
